We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I ?m standin ? there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say,  ,Hello ,
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin ? pebbles
And my daddy said,  ,Stay away from Juliet ,
And I was cryin ? on the staircase
Beggin ? you,  ,Please don ?t go,  , and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I ?ll be waiting, all there ?s left to do is run
You ?ll be the prince and I ?ll be the princess
It ?s a love story, baby, just say,  ,Yes ,
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet,  ?cause we ?re dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh
 ?Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said,  ,Stay away from Juliet ,
But you were everything to me
I was beggin ? you,  ,Please don ?t go,  , and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I ?ll be waiting, all there ?s left to do is run
You ?ll be the prince and I ?ll be the princess
It ?s a love story, baby, just say,  ,Yes ,
Romeo, save me, they ?re tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it ?s real
Don ?t be afraid, we ?ll make it out of this mess
It ?s a love story, baby, just say,  ,Yes ,
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin ? if you were ever comin ? around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I ?ve been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don ?t know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said,  ,Marry me, Juliet
You ?ll never have to be alone
I love you and that ?s all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It ?s a love story, baby, just say,  ,Yes ,
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
 ?Cause we were both young when I first saw youGo-go-go-go-go-gods

Ay, this is what you came for, blood on the game ball
Everybody dropping like rainfall

Think church just opened
And they &re singing your praises, la-la-la
Screaming your name out lo-lo-loud
One more step, you &re immortal now,  &cause
Once you play God, once you play God

Baby, we &re go-go-go-go-go-gods
Yeah, we &re go-go-go-go-go-gods
Ay, welcome to the big show, next on the ladder

Brief-brief-brief moment of silence
Bad girl woke up and chose violence
And they &re singing my praises, la-la-la
Screaming my name out lo-lo-loud
This is why we &re immortal now,  &cause
Once you play God, once you play God

Welcome to the war, we ve only begun, so
