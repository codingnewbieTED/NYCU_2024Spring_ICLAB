Lately, I +ve been, I +ve been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I +ve been, I +ve been praying hard
Said,  :No more counting dollars, we +ll be counting stars :
Yeah, we +ll be counting stars
I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old, but I +m not that old
Young, but I +m not that bold
And I don +t think the world is sold
On just doing what we +re told
I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn +t lie, couldn +t lie, couldn +t lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I +ve been, I +ve been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I +ve been, I +ve been praying hard
Said,  :No more counting dollars, we +ll be counting stars :
Lately, I +ve been, I +ve been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things we could be
But baby, I +ve been, I +ve been praying hard
Said,  :No more counting dollars, we +ll be, we +ll be counting stars :
Yeah, yeah
I feel your love, and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I +m not that old
Young, but I +m not that bold
And I don +t think the world is sold
On just doing what we +re told
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn +t lie, couldn +t lie, couldn +t lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately, I +ve been, I +ve been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I +ve been, I +ve been praying hard
Said,  :No more counting dollars, we +ll be counting stars :

But baby, I +ve been, I +ve been praying hard
Said,  :No more counting dollars, we +ll be, we +ll be counting stars :
Oh, take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I +ve learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I +ve learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I +ve learned
Take that money, watch it burn

Ay, this is what you came for, blood on the game ball
Everybody dropping like rainfall
Uh, this is your moment, eyes on the pulpit, kid
Think church just opened
And they re singing your praises, la-la-la
Screaming your name out lo-lo-loud
One more step, you re immortal now,  cause
Once you play God, once you play God
They re gonna crumble one by one
Then we gon  ride right into the sun
Like it s the day my kingdom come
Baby, we re go-go-go-go-go-gods
Yeah, we re go-go-go-go-go-gods
Ay, welcome to the big show, next on the ladder
Is it your name in the rafters?
Brief-brief-brief moment of silence
Bad girl woke up and chose violence
And they re singing my praises, la-la-la
Screaming my name out lo-lo-loud
This is why we re immortal now,  cause
Once you play God, once you play God
They re gonna crumble one by one (crumble one by one)
Then we gon  ride right into the sun
Like it s the day my kingdom come
Baby, we re go-go-go-go-go-gods
Yeah, we re go-go-go-go-go-gods
I m on my knees, pray for glory
Anyone read this underdog story?
I can t lose myself again
Help me raise this heart
Heart, unbreakable

They re gonna crumble one by one
Then we gon  ride right into the sun
Like it s the day my kingdom come
